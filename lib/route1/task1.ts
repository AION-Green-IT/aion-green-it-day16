/**
 * Task 1 — "Clarity Digital Services: which metrics really help?" ~15
 * minutes, Level 1 only. Three stages, each a small decision-first
 * mechanic rather than a free-form guess (CLAUDE.md §4):
 *
 *  Stage A — drag ten signal cards into the six areas M3 teaches. A primary
 *  area is required; a secondary area is an optional second tag, since a
 *  few signals genuinely touch two areas at once.
 *  Stage B — six candidate metrics, each resolved into "Effective for
 *  Management" or "Merely Informative" by one qualifying question (M4's six
 *  gates: a sound number AND a wired one — target, decision, owner), never
 *  free-dragged.
 *  Stage C — the same six-gate idea read as effort rather than quality: sort
 *  six concrete moves into what can be built short-term versus what has to
 *  be built structurally.
 *
 * Scope note: the build brief's live-report spec also asks for a per-signal
 * free-text "what this tells us" line. Ten of those, on top of six area
 * write-ups and two further classification stages, would not fit the
 * task's own ~15-minute budget — so that line is folded into the one
 * required, per-area "first improvement approach" field instead, and is not
 * duplicated per signal (flagged here per the standing instruction to
 * surface a scope discrepancy rather than silently bloat the task).
