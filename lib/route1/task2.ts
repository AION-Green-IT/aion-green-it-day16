This is a genuinely open exercise, not a disguised single-answer one — the material explicitly withholds a model priority. A learner who picks A or B defensibly (naming the 'no review logic' or 'slow and ungoverned' risk up front, per the clue engine) should be graded on the quality of the defence, not marked down for disagreeing with C. Use this key to answer a participant who pushes back: C is the safer, faster-to-value, lower-risk pick; A is the most visible near-term win if management needs something to point at; B is the strongest long-term credibility story if the review process is added quickly alongside it.",
