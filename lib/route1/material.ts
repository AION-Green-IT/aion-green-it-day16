/**
 * Route 1's material, split into the two blocks the build brief asks for:
 * M1–M4 teach only what Task 1's diagnosis needs, M5–M7 teach only what
 * Task 2's prioritisation needs (coverage rule, CLAUDE.md §11a — every term
 * either task uses is defined here first: the three links, metric layers, the
 * six areas and the six gates, PDCA, the three pulls, the three lines and the
 * conditions Task 2 names).
 *
 * What stays on screen per card: a one-line standfirst, the live diagram and a
 * short `definition`. The decision rules, depth and sources sit behind Read
 * more (DEPTH-UPGRADE-PROMPT §2.1). Practice cases inside the diagrams are
 * deliberately *not* the task's cases, so nothing here hands over a task answer.
 *
 * `n` is the card's position within its own block (1–4, then 1–3 again), not
 * a running count across both — each block renders its own "Card n of N".
