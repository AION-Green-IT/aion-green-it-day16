 * The four D1–D4 micro-cards — the whole teaching block for Route 2, read

 * instrument reframe (D1), short/medium/structural staging plus the eight
 * twelve-month decisions the task offers (D2), the five trade-off factors
 * (D3), and the four role lenses plus the four responsibilities the task hands
 * out (D4). Nothing in the task depends on Route 1.
 *
 * What stays on screen per card: a one-line standfirst, the live diagram and a
 * short `definition`. Decision rules, depth and sources sit behind Read more.
 * Practice cases inside the diagrams are deliberately not Verdeon.
